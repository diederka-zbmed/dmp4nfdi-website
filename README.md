# DMP44NFDI

DMP4NFDI is a centralised Basic Service for managing data management plans (DMPs) and software management plans (SMPs) across the NFDI. It will host the open-source DMP tool RDMO, coordinate template creation, standardise content, and offer guidance and support to consortia staff responsible for DMPs. The service aims to enhance communication among stakeholders, support data collection and review processes, and foster interoperability by engaging consortia early on to refine requirements and develop standardised DMP templates. Ultimately, DMP4NFDI seeks to maximise the benefits of widespread DMP adoption by promoting interoperability and integration across the NFDI's research data ecosystem.

# Using this template

  1. [Click here to use this template in your own repository](https://github.com/new?template_name=website-template-hugo&template_owner=base4nfdi) or ask the Base4NFDI staff to create one for you in the Base4NFDI organisation
  2. Enable GitHub pages from GitHub actions in the settings (Settings ➜ Pages ➜ Source: GitHub Actions)
  3. Re-run the action to deploy the site (Actions ➜ click on last failed action ➜ top-right ‘re-run all actions’)
  4. The site should be available under https://base4nfdi.github.io/your-repo-name, where base4nfdi is the organisation or user under which you created the repository

# Adding a custom domain name

GitHub has [extensive documentation on this](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#dns-records-for-your-custom-domain). Basically it boils down to:

  1. Ask the Base4NFDI team to set a DNS CNAME record for your desired domain with looks like `todo.services.base4nfdi.de.    CNAME    base4nfdi.github.io.`
  Where of course todo.services.base4nfdi.de. needs to be replaced by your subdomain and if you used another GitHub organisation base4nfdi.github.io by the GitHub organisation your repository belongs to 
  2. Now the custom domain can be set in the project. Again in Settings ➜ Pages enter your domain (todo.services.base4nfdi.de) into the custom domain box and hit save. If the DNS check fails, wait a bit to make sure the change is published, otherwise make sure your DNS record is correct (e.g. missing dot at the end)
  3. After the DNS check passes, lastly set the new domain in the website configuration itself, so for this template in config/\_default/hugo.yaml. After the GitHub action ran again, your site should be ready and available under the new domain!
